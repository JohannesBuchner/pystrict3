This is an example for using the Python binding PyMuPDF of MuPDF.

This program extracts the text of an input PDF and writes it in a text file.
The input file name is provided as a parameter to this script (sys.argv[1])
The output file name is input-filename appended with ".txt".
Encoding of the text in the PDF is assumed to be UTF-8.
Change the ENCODING variable as required.
