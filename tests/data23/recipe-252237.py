""" 
From the SWI-Prolog manual:
dwim_match(+Atom1, +Atom2)

       Succeeds if Atom1 matches Atom2 in `Do What I Mean' sense. Both
       Atom1 and Atom2 may also be integers or floats. The two atoms
       match if:

        o They are identical
        o They differ by one character (spy == spu)
        o One character is inserted/deleted (debug == deug)

        o Two characters are transposed (trace == tarce)

        o `Sub-words' are glued differently (existsfile == existsFile
        == exists_file)

        o Two adjacent sub words are transposed (existsFile == fileExists)

Thanks for M.L. Hetland for writing a Levenshtein Distance function in Py.
Thanks to Bijan Parsia for pointing me to SWI-Prolog's DWIM algo.
