 Watch That Post!
 A simple Python script to "watch" a post. I wrote this to
 watch posts on LiveJournal, but actually you can use it
 to watch any URL.

 To use the script:
	1. Create a file (e.g., urls.txt) and add the URLs
	   you want to watch - each URL on a new line.
	2. Change the variable period to whatever seconds
	   you want to let the script sleep.
	3. Run the program: python watch.py

		fp.close()
		sys.exit(0)

	urls_lines = fp.readlines()
	orig_content = ""
