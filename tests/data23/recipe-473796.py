# a better better command line calculator,
#
# put this in a file, run it, cut and past a bunch of numbers (don't
# worry about the $ signs and commas) hit enter and it adds them up
# use / * -  + like normal
#
# added features over just using python as a command line calculator
# * numbers can include ,s and $s or anything really and it still works
#   this allows you to cut and paste things like $1,123.65 and it still works
# * add by default! (unless you run with -x)
#   cut and paste a bunch of numbers hit enter and it'll add them all up
# * command line history and readline, up arrow recalls your history
#   even between sessions
# * _ is the last answer, just like in python
