"""
For a given number, prints Pascal's Triangle upside-down up to that line.

Takes advantage of the fact that the Triangle is symmetric.
Uses the combinatorics property of the Triangle: 
	For any NUMBER in position INDEX at row ROW:
	NUMBER = C(ROW, INDEX)

A hash map stores the values of the combinatorics already calculated, so
the recursive function speeds up a little.

Prints everything alligned at first, but starts screwing up at about 13.
