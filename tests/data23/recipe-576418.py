    A thread can 'close' the gate by calling the method 'close'.
    This thread becomes the owner of the gate. Any other thread
    calling 'enter' after this is automatically blocked till
    the owner calls reopens the gate by calling 'open'.

    The gate requires a certain number of threads to block
    before the owner exits from the 'close' method. Otherwise,
    the owner waits for a timeout before returning from the 'close'
    method, without actually closing the gate.
    
    The gate class can be used to block running threads for a 
    particular operation and making sure that they resume after
    the operation is complete, for a fixed number of threads.
