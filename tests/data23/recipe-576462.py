class MultiThreadedPool:
    """
    A simple variant of processing.Pool that accepts requests
    from different threads: makes sure that requests being processed by
    the worker processes are not redundant.

    When a thread B submits a request which is already being processed
    in the background for another thread A, then B doesn't re-submit the
    request: it waits for the same result object as A.

    This package makes the following asumption:
    - the result of the function to call is entirely determined by its
      arguments (resp. "function", "params")

    As a consequence, in order to determine whether a "request" has
    already been submitted by another thread, we ONLY compare the
    couples (function, params). If a submitted request has the same
    couple (function, params) as a request in progress, then we wait
    for this request to be completed (valid result, or exception)

    This Pool should be safe wrt exceptions in the remote function.
    Only the map() and imap() methods are implemented.
