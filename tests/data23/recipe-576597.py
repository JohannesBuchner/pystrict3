#   Dir Walking File Renamer

#   Inspired by several recipes, especially:
#   http://code.activestate.com/recipes/105873/
#
#   This module reads a file that contains a list of directory names.
#   It visits each directory in that file, and renames the files found
#   in those directories.
#   The base path is the path where the file was found.
#   The files are renamed based the directory name, with some unique
#   identifier added onto the end of that name.
#
#   I use this for the photos I download from my camera. I rename the
#   directory to reflect the subject (creating new directories if
#   necessary--like when I take multiple photos on a particular day)
#   and then let all the photos take that name.  The date of the photo
#   is part of the directory name (a setting from the camera software)
#   and then I upload everything to Fotki (in general, not in this
#   module) and all the photos have the date and the subject in their
#   file name.
