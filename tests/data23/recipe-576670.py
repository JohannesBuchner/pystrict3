gen_twpol.py is a script that can be used to generate a tripwire policy source (twpol.txt) for your system.

This script may be distributed under the terms of the Gnu Public License GPLv2 or later.

For more information on the open source version of tripwire see http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/

The tripwire source package usually ships with a an example twpol.txt file based on a RedHat Enterprise (RHEL)
distribution, typically an RHEL4 or RHEL5 version.  It doesn't do much good to have this get parked by your Gentoo
ebuild (nor other distro packager) as all sorts of stuff in /boot, /lib/modules and other places will be
out of sync, differently named or just plain missing.  In addition, your system may have extra stuff that isn't
present in the file but critical to the distro.

To use this script, park it in the tripwire config directory (probably /etc/tripwire).  Copy your existing twpol.txt
to twpol_header.txt and hack it up to remove the middle section of rules for the directories which will be scanned in
the crit_dir list.  You will want to keep the sections at the bottom for root's home dir and things like /home.  The
output from this script would then be appended to the header contents.

You will still want to tweak the root homedir rule section to take into account your prefs for window manager and the
settings for other dot files.  You should also do a quick sanity check of the output to fine tune the results before
generating a policy file with twadmin.  Since the list can be quite large, it may take 10 minutes or more for twadmin
to parse and create the encrypted policy.  A common problem is having a directory called out in a rule in the header
which is part of the crit_dirs and their subdirectories.  Tripwire doesn't like overlapping rules.
