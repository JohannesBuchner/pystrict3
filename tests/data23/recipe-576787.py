"""
Alias allows the dynamic aliasing of class attributes to a sequence of aliases
using metaclass programming to give a declarative way of expressing aliases as
an inner class on the object in question.

The main use of such a system would be to unify a disparate set of objects with
similar, but differently named attributes so that they can access be a single
piece of code.

Taking the example below, we define two types of records - an old-style and
new-style record. Note that the attributes on the class describe the same
things, but are named differently. By declaring a set of suitable aliases on
each style class we can then include both styles in our record set and treat
them as one:

>>> from alias import NewRecord, OldRecord, RecordSet
>>> rs = RecordSet(NewRecord(), OldRecord())
>>> rs.records
[<alias.NewRecord object at ...>, <alias.OldRecord object at ...>]
>>> rs.sort_by_added()
>>> rs.records
[<alias.OldRecord object at ...>, <alias.NewRecord object at ...>]
>>> [r.removed for r in rs.records]
[False, False]
>>> rs.mark_all_as_removed()
>>> [r.removed for r in rs.records]
[True, True]
>>> [r.deleted for r in rs.records]
[True, True]
>>> for r in rs.records: r.save()
Storing record: Old type record
Saving record: New style record
