"""worker.py: Executes inline code across multiple execution contexts.

The inline code to be executed is contained in a generator, which contains a
`yield` statement to signal each context change. A decorator added to the
generator function wraps the returned generator in the executor when the
generator function is called. Calling the returned executor iterates the
generator to completion, handling the context switching at each `yield`. The
executor and generator can communicate values through the `yield` statements
and `send()` method of the generator.

An example is provided of an executor which executes alternate iterations of a
generator asynchronously (in a `Thread`) and synchronously (in an event loop).
