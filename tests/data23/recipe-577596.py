# DO NOT TAKE THIS EXAMPLE TO SERIOUSLY... :)
#
# A demo analogue and digital readout using standard Python Version 1.4.x
# for a classic AMIGA A1200, Version 2.4.x for Windows ME to Vista+ and
# Version 2.5.2 for Linux. Used in CLI/Command-Prompt/Terminal mode.
# I do have a Python 3.x.x version and will upload that later... :o)
#
# This uses an experimental module that clears the screen and generates a
# beep on platforms AMIGA, MS-DOS window or screen using MS Windows ME to
# Vista and Linux using Kernel 2.4+...
