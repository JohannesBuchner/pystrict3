# SevenBitBargraph2x.py
#
# A DEMO 7 bit analogue bargraph generator in colour for STANDARD Python 2.6.x and Linux...
#
# (Original copyright, (C)2010, B.Walker, G0LCU.)
# A Python 3.x version can be found here:-
# http://www.linuxformat.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=13443
#
# Saved as SevenBitBargraph2x.py wherever you like.
#
# This DEMO goes from safe green, to warning amber, to danger red, with a crirical
# error beep above 120 on the horizontal scale...
#
# Two system commands are required, "clear" and "setterm", for this to work.
# I assume that these are available on all recent and current Linux distros.
# The device /dev/audio is used so this must be free also. 
#
# It is useful for quick glance readings from say an 8 bit ADC used as a simple
# voltmeter, etc. Getting a digital readout is SO simple I left it out this time...
#
# To run use the following from inside a Python prompt...
# >>> exec(open("/full/path/to/code/SevenBitBargraph2x.py").read())
# OR...
# >>> execfile("/full/path/to/code/SevenBitBargraph2x.py").read()
# Tested on Debian 6.0.0 with Python 2.6.6.

# Add the required imports for this DEMO.
