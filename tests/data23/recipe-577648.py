# Arduino-Windows2x.py

#
# DEMO Arduino Diecimila Board and below, serial access, using standard
# Python and Windows 32 bit installs.

#

# This is an experimental idea only to test the Arduino Diecimila

# development board under Python 2.2.x to 2.6.x; (assume Python 2.6.x).

# (It is assumed that the Python install uses the default folders.)

# This working idea is copyright, (C)2008, B.Walker, G0LCU.

#
# Pyserial is NOT needed AT ALL for this to work.
#

# NOW issued entirely as Public Domain. You may do with it as you please...

#

# Copy this 'Arduino-Windows2x.py' file into the 'C:\Python26\Lib\' folder

# and you will be ready to roll... ;-)

#

# To run type:-

# >>> execfile("C:\\Python26\\Lib\\Arduino-Windows2x.py")<RETURN/ENTER>

# OR......

# >>> import Arduino-Windows2x<RETURN/ENTER>

#
# And away you go...
#

# Press ~Ctrl C~ to QUIT, OR, set input to maximum of 5V, i.e. 255.



# Do any imports as required.

import os



# Start off with a basic cleared screen...

os.system('CLS')



# The program proper.
