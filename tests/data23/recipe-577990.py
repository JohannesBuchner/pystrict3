# SweepGen2x.py
#
# A DEMO Audio Sweep Generator from 4KHz down to 100Hz and back up again
# using standard Text Mode Python. Another kids level piece of simple, FREE,
# Test Gear project code...
# This working idea is copyright, (C)2010, B.Walker, G0LCU.
# Written in such a way that anyone can understand how it works.
#
# Tested on PCLinuxOS 2009 and Debian 6.0.0 using Python 2.6.2, 2.6.6 and 2.7.2.
# It may well work on much earlier versions of Python but it is untested...
# "/dev/dsp" IS required for this to work; therefore if you haven't got it then
# install "oss-compat" from you distro's repository. Ensure the sound system is
# not already in use.
# It is easily possible to lengthen the higher frequency playing times and VERY
# easily alter the output level and to speed up or slow down the sweep speed.
# I'll let the big guns do that for you...
# IMPORTANT NOTE:- Every EVEN number of characters is a symmetrical "square" wave
# BUT every ODD number of characters has preference for the "space" by one character.
#
# To run this DEMO type at the Python prompt......
#
# >>> execfile("/full/path/to/SweepGen2x.py")<RETURN/ENTER>
#
# ......and away you go.
#
# Note:- NO import[s] required at all, good eh! ;o)
