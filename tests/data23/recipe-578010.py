# MPO2x.py
#
# A DEMO, very crude, Morse Code Practice Oscillator...
# Tested on Debian 6.0.0 using Python 2.6.6 and 2.7.2 and PCLinuxOS 2009 using Python 2.5.2.
# It may well work on earlier Python versions but is untested.
#
# (C)2011-2012, B.Walker, G0LCU. Now issued as Public Domain...
#
# The device, "/dev/audio" is required for this to work. Install "oss-compat" from your
# distro's repository if you haven't got "/dev/audio". Ensure the sound system is NOT
# in use by other programs and use the OS's mixing facilities to set the levels.
#
# Copy the file to the Lib folder(/drawer/directory) or where the modules
# reside as "MPO2x.py"...
#
# For a quick way to run just use at the ">>>" prompt:-
#
# >>> import MPO2x<RETURN/ENTER>
#
# And away we go...
#
# Written in such a way that youngsters can understand what is going on.
