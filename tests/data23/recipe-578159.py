"""
A 'state tree' is (as its name implies) an object that represents a tree of
states.  The tree is built by having an initial state (the 'root') and a
rule whereby child states can be reached from a parent state.

State trees are useful, for example, in solving puzzles where there are a
fixed set of moves from any given position, and a goal position which is
the solution.  A couple of example puzzles are given below.
