# Talbot suggested that the Bromwich line be deformed into a contour that begins
# and ends in the left half plane, i.e., z \to \infty at both ends.
# Due to the exponential factor the integrand decays rapidly
# on such a contour. In such situations the trapezoidal rule converge
# extraordinarily rapidly.
# For example here we compute the inverse transform of F(s) = 1/(s+1) at t = 1
#
# >>> error = Talbot(1,24)-exp(-1)
# >>> error
#   (3.3306690738754696e-015+0j)
#
# Talbot method is very powerful here we see an error of 3.3e-015
# with only 24 function evaluations
