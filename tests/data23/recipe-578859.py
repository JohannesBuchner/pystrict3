# Function "get_input" verifies the input. As "raw_input" does not accept an int
# as input (which is what we need), the function converts the input into a str
# and checks whether the str is a digit. If so it converts the str to an int and
# returns it. If not the user is prompted again for an input. A float is not a
# valid input ("isdigit" would not be True). You can convert an int to a str but
# not a float to a str. The return value is used to define the number of trials.
