dunderdoc.py
A Python function to print the .__doc__ attribute (i.e. the docstring) 
of each item in a list of names given as the argument.
The function is called dunderdoc because it is an informal convention 
in the Python community to call attributes such as __name__, that begin 
and end with a double underscore, dunder-name, and so on.
