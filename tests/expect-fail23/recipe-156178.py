"""pathwatcher.py - Monitor a directory for file additions / deletions
Watch a named directory for any new or removed files. More sophisticated
 notifications could be added, for example looking for changes in file
 sizes etc. It doesn't seem possible to determine from the system call
 *which* files were added or removed, so the simple expedient is adopted
 of listing all files before waiting and then comparing with the
 equivalent list when notified.
