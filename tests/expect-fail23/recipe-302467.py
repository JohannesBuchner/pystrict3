# SectionPath.py

"""This module provides a simple utility to follow the path to an item in a
recursive tree structure. It can be used to build the section numbers for a
table of contents.

Instances of the SectionPath class are immutable and do not need to be
instantiated directly. Instead, use the "start" instance to begin the
descent into your tree.

Example:

>>> import SectionPath
>>> SectionPath.start
<SectionPath.SectionPath object at 0x4022580c>
>>> print SectionPath.start
1
>>> print SectionPath.start.sibling
2
>>> print SectionPath.start.sibling.child
2.1
>>> print SectionPath.start.sibling.child.child
2.1.1
>>> print SectionPath.start.sibling.child.child.sibling
2.1.2
>>> print SectionPath.start.sibling.child.child.sibling.sibling
2.1.3

See the bottom of this file for a real example of this module's use.
