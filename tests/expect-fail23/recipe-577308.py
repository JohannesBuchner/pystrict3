'''a very simple idiom for a state machine'''

from random import random
from time import sleep


# Each of the state functions below performs some action and then implements
# logic to choose next state.  Each state function returns the next state.

def state0():
    print("state0")
    # delay and decision path to simulate some application logic
    sleep(.5)
    if random()>.5:
        return state1
    else:
        return state2

def state1():
    print("state1")
    # delay and decision path to simulate some application logic
    sleep(.5)
    if random()>.5:
        return state0
    else:
        return state2

def state2():
    print("state2")
    # delay and decision path to simulate some application logic
    sleep(.5)
    if random()>.5:
        return state0
    else:
        return None

state=state0    # initial state
while state: state=state()  # launch state machine
print("Done with states")
