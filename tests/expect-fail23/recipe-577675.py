# 4BitVerticalBargraph2x.py
#
# A DEMO 4 bit slow analogue bargraph generator in colour for STANDARD Python 2.6.x and Linux...
# This is a vertical version of the horizontal one also given away by myself.
# It is written so that anyone can understand how it works.
#
# (Original copyright, (C)2011, B.Walker, G0LCU.)
# Issued initially to LXF as Public Domain, and to other sites later.
#
# Saved as 4BitVerticalBargraph2x.py wherever you like.
#
# This DEMO goes from safe green, to warning amber, to danger red, with a crirical
# error beep above 14 on the vertical scale...
# It is a slow "AT A GLANCE" display for quick assessments, not for accuracy.
#
# Two system commands are required, "clear" and "setterm", for this to work.
# I assume that these are available on all recent and current Linux distros.
# The device /dev/audio is used so this must be free also. 
#
# It is useful for quick "AT A GLANCE" readings from say an 8 bit ADC used as a simple
# voltmeter, ammeter, etc. Getting a digital readout is SO simple I left it out this time...
#
# To run use the following from inside a Python prompt...
# >>> exec(open("/full/path/to/code/4BitVerticalBargraph2x.py").read())
# OR...
# >>> execfile("/full/path/to/code/4BitVerticalBargraph2x.py")
#
# This looks like an "LED" style "VU" display...
